A game I made that allows you to play a game of Rock Paper Scissors with the computer. It does this by taking the users input and generating a list from it. Then using the randrange function the computer randomly generates a number between 0 and 2, which allows the CPU to pick a move to play against the user. Then using IF statements the rules of the game are made which allows the game to function correctly.
